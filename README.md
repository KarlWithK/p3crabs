## API Card
[We used the pokeAPI for sprites.](https://github.com/stuy-softdev/notes-and-code20-21/blob/master/api_kb/411_on_pokeAPI.md)
[We used the marvel API for a Guess-That-Superhero!](https://github.com/stuy-softdev/notes-and-code20-21/blob/master/api_kb/411_on_Marvel.md)
[Finally we used the trivia API to get multiple choice questions.](https://github.com/stuy-softdev/notes-and-code20-21/blob/master/api_kb/411_on_OpenTriviaDB.md)
